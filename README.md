# About Naruto-Uzumaki

  In this project, I've decided to do one of my favorite anime characters which is Naruto Uzumaki.  [Naruto (1999)](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_%28series%29)
 is one of my first animes I've come across on. It is also the reason why I started to work out to become a different person. 


> And my dream is to be the greatest Hokage! That way, people will stop disrespecting me and start treating me like I'm somebody. Someone important!"

# Childhood/Background

[Naruto Uzumaki](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CoolChange-Kakemono-Roll-up-Poster-Naruto/dp/B00XIAR3AO) is fictional character who strives to one day to become the hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village. When he was a baby, his parents Minato Uzumaki and Kushina died after the sudden attack on the Hidden Leaf Village. The village was attacked by the name of Madara Uchiha, later discovered to be Obito Uchiha. 

Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure. He became the [jinchūriki](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Jinch%C5%ABriki) of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as The Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the [***Fourth Shinobi World War***](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_Shinobi_World_War), leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage.

# Plans for Future Development
In the future, I would like to talk about other characters in [the anime (2002)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409591/)/[manga of Naruto(1999)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Naruto_volumes) because all the characters make up the story of how Naruto became the Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village. In addition, in the future, I would try to add more historical background on the anime/manga itself throughout it's serialization.
